# Zakk's Portfolio Site

<pre>
A website where you can get to know me. You'll find a bit about me, a section showcasing my personal work, 
and links to ways you can contact me.

## Notes to grader.
<pre>
 The images in the projects section are placeholders. I may update them as I complete more side projects.

 I also took some liberties with this project. While it asked for the images of my other projects to grow, I personally find this tacky.
Instead I added a simple animation that causes them to flash briefly, for a more subtle effect. I've also added a dynamic nav bar
that will change based on the screen size, along with a smooth scrolling effect when nav buttons are clicked. 
Any feedback on these implementations is appreciated. :)

p.s. this message will self destruct after grade is receieved. (Not really. But I will remove it from the readme.md)
